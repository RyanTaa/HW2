# Homework 2 - CMSC408 - Fall 2024

## Project Description

For this project, I was tasked with choosing 3 different scenarios. With those scenarios, I had to create a Chen Notation and Crows Foot Notation diagram for each of them, and then I had to answer questions relating to the diagrams I made for each scenario. I was provided with the scaffold git repo to build my project off of. It was slightly confusing in the beginning understanding how to make the diagrams, but after a little bit of testing it became fairly simple. Once I figured it out it was smooth sailing from there and I was able to implement everything.
